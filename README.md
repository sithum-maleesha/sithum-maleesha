I am an undergraduate Computer science student at SITC Campus. C, C++, Python, Javascript, HTML, and Shell are the programming languages I am good at. I love to learn and build something new, productive, innovative and creative.
* **I like solving problems that sit at the crossroads of design, development, and human behavior.**
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
  - Java
  - React js
- 📖 I’m looking forward to collaborate on open source projects.
- ✔ Ask me about anything, I am happy to help, only if the ball is in my court!😉<br>
- Outside tech, 🔍 I explore new ideas and perspectives, 🧠 I enjoy learning independently books, blogs, courses, anything, 🛠 I keep up with new technologies and trends not to chase hype, but to understand what matters.
